## Architectural Styles

Choosing the right architectural style is one of the most **crucial early decisions** 
in software projects. Architectural style impacts how components interact, how 
responsibilities are divided, and how well the system meets its quality attributes.

The most common architectural styles are:

* [Introduction](introduction/README.md)

* [Layered Architectures](layered/README.md)

* [Client-Server Architectures](client-server/README.md)

* [Message-Oriented Architectures](message-oriented/README.md)

* [Microservices](microservices/README.md)

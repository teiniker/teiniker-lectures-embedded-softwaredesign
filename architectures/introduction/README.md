# Introduction

Software architecture is a fundamental aspect of software engineering that 
defines the **high-level structure of a software system**. 

It encompasses the organization of a systemâ€™s components, the relationships 
and interactions between them, and the guiding principles and decisions 
that shape its development and evolution. 

Understanding software architecture is crucial for creating robust, scalable, 
maintainable, and efficient software applications.

The most important aspect of a good software architecture is **Modularity**:

* A modular architecture can be **easily tested automatically**.

* A modular architecture can be **easily changed and extended**.


A well-defined software architecture also offers other **benefits**:

* **Scalability**: Facilitates the system's ability to handle growth, whether 
    in terms of users, data, or functionality.

* **Maintainability**: Makes it easier to update, modify, or fix parts of the 
    system without affecting the whole.

* **Reusability**: Promotes the use of existing components in new contexts, 
    reducing development time and costs.

* **Risk Management**: Identifies potential issues early in the design phase, 
    mitigating risks related to technology, integration, and performance.

* **Performance**: Ensures that the system operates efficiently and meets
    performance benchmarks.

* **Communication**: Provides a common language and framework for stakeholders, 
    including developers, managers, and clients, to discuss the system.



## Notations for Software Architecture

A variety of **modeling notations** exist to capture different views of a 
software system. Common standards and approaches include:

### Unified Modeling Language (UML)

UML is one of the **most widely used** notations for software design. 
Some relevant diagrams for software architectures include:

* **Class Diagram**: Shows classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships 
    (inheritance, association).

* **Package Diagram**: Organizes classes into packages or modules, showing 
    dependencies between them.

* **Component Diagram**: Depicts high-level components (modules, subsystems) and 
    their interfaces.

* **Sequence Diagram**: Details object interactions in a time sequence (useful 
    for describing flows and messaging).

* **Deployment Diagram**: Represents the physical deployment of artifacts (e.g., 
    executables, databases) on hardware nodes.

UML is flexible; architects can pick and choose the diagrams most helpful for 
their context.


### SysML (Systems Modeling Language)

SysML is based on UML but extended for systems engineering. While it is more common 
in complex, **multidisciplinary systems** (e.g., embedded systems that combine software, 
hardware, mechanical components), it can still be used in software-centric projects 
where you want a broader system-level perspective.


###  BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)
Though primarily used for modeling business processes, BPMN can be relevant for 
capturing workflow and process-oriented aspects of the system. It clarifies how data 
and tasks move between services and participants (which can inform the architecture).


## Architectural Styles

Choosing the right architectural style is one of the most **crucial early decisions** 
in software projects. Architectural style impacts how components interact, how 
responsibilities are divided, and how well the system meets its quality attributes.

The most common architectural styles are:

* [Layered Architectures](../layered/README.md)

* [Client-Server Architectures](../client-server/README.md)

* [Message-Oriented Architectures](../message-oriented/README.md)

* [Microservices](../microservices/README.md)

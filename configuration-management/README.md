# Configuration Management

Configuration management refers to the process by which all artifacts relevant 
to a project, and the relationships between them, are stored, retrieved, 
uniquely identified, and modified.

We select the following topics from a wide range of configuration management 
techniques used in C++:

    * [Build Automation](configuration-management/building/)
        * [CMake](building/cmake/)
    * [Test Automation](configuration-management/testing/)
        * [GoogleTest](configuration-management/testing/googletest/)
    * [Unified Modeling Language](configuration-management/uml/)
    * [Source Code Versioning](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-computerscience/tree/master/configuration-management/versioning)

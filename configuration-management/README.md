# Introduction to Configuration Management 

## Phases of Software Development

Regardless of which process model you use for software development, the following phases of 
software development must always be completed.

![Phases of Software Development](figures/PhasesOfSoftwareDevelopment.png)

In every phase we need configuration management techniques:

* **Requirements Analysis**: The functional and non-functional requirements as well as existing 
    framework conditions are defined in discussion with the customer.
    
    The result of the requirement analysis are use case specifications, which are summarized 
    in a **requirement document**.

* **Architecture and Design**: The structure of the software system is defined. Abstraction 
    divides the overall functionality into components that interact through specified interfaces 
    and protocols. 
    
    Architectural and design decisions are captured in the **design document**, which usually 
    also contains UML diagrams.

* **Implementation**: The functionalities of the components are further subdivided until they 
    can be implemented with the constructs of a programming language. Every part of the 
    implementation is verified by automated tests. 
    
    The result of this phase is the **source code** as well as various **configuration files** 
    and **software libraries**.

* **System Integration**: The software components are integrated, and the software system is 
    checked to see whether it meets its requirements. 
    
    After a successful acceptance test, the software system (**software release**) is 
    delivered to the customer. 

* **Operation and Maintenance**: This is by far the longest phase in the life cycle of a software 
    product. The software has been installed and is in use as a running system. 
    
    Maintenance activities **eliminate bugs** that have not been discovered by then. 
    This phase also includes the addition of **new functionalities** as requirements change 
    over time - **Software Evolution**.


## Configuration Management

> **Configuration management (CM)** refers to the process by which all artifacts relevant 
> to a project, and the relationships between them, are stored, retrieved, uniquely 
> identified, and modified.

Successful configuration management includes at least the following activities:

* [**Version Control**](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-computerscience/tree/master/configuration-management/versioning)

    Version control systems are a mechanism for **keeping multiple versions
    of our files**, so that when we modify a file, we can still access the 
    previous revisions.

    A version control system:
    * Retains, and provides access to, **every version of every file** that has 
        ever been stored in it. 
    * Provides **metadata** (information that describes the data stored) attached 
        to single files or collections of files. 
    * Allows teams that may be distributed across space and time to **collaborate**.

* [**Build Automation**](building/cmake/)
    
    Having a **common project layout** is fundamental to successful software 
    development. It refers to adopting a standardized directory structure and 
    file organization that is widely recognized and utilized within the developer 
    community.

    _See also:_ [Layout of C/C++ projects](building/project-layout/README.md)

    Getting the sources turned into a running system involves compilation, moving 
    files around, loading schemas into the databases, and so on. 
    Typing in commands or clicking through dialog boxes is a waste of time and 
    a breeding ground for mistakes. These tasks should be automated.

    _See also:_ [Steps of a C/C++ build process](building/build-steps/)

    Tools for automated builds are a common feature of systems. The C/C++ world has 
    had **GNU make** for decades and uses **CMake** these days. 

    Make sure we can build and launch our system using these tools in a single command.

    _See also:_ [C/C++ compiler flags](building/compiler-flags/)
    
* [**Test Automation**](testing/)
    
    A compiled program may run, but that doesn't mean it does the right thing. 
    A good way to catch bugs more quickly and efficiently is to **include automated 
    tests in the build process**. 

    **Testing isn't perfect**, but it can catch a lot of bugs - enough to be useful. 

    **Extreme Programming (XP)** and **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** have 
    done a great deal to popularize self-testing code and as a result many 
    people have seen the value of the technique.

* [**Debugging**](debugging/README.md)

    Debugging is the **systematic process of identifying, analyzing, and resolving 
    defects** or "bugs" which employs various tools and techniques within the 
    software development. 

* [**Generative AI**](generative-ai/README.md)

    Generative AI is increasingly transforming software development by enhancing 
    the traditional **pair programming model**. Pair programming involves two developers 
    working collaboratively on the same codebase, typically with one writing code 
    (the "driver") and the other reviewing and providing guidance (the "navigator").


## Continuous Integration

> **Continuous Integration (CI)** is a software development practice where members 
> of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least 
> daily â€“ leading to multiple integrations per day. 

Each **integration is verified by an automated build (including test)** to 
detect integration errors as quickly as possible.

![Continuous Integration](figures/ContinuousIntegration.png)

1. A **developer commits code** to the version control repository. 
2. The CI server detects that changes have occurred in the version control 
    repository, so the **CI server retrieves the latest copy of the code** 
    from the repository and **executes a build script**. 
3. The CI server generates **feedback** (HTML reports, emails) for project 
    members.
4. The **CI server continues to poll for changes** in the version control 
    repository.

**Benefits of Continuous Integration**:

* The greatest and most wide-ranging benefit of Continuous Integration 
    is **reduced risk**.
* At all times **you know where you are**, what works, what doesn't, the 
    outstanding bugs you have in your system.
* Continuous Integrations doesn't get rid of **bugs**, but it does make 
    them dramatically **easier to find and remove**.
    As a result, projects with Continuous Integration tend to have dramatically 
    **less bugs**, both in production and in process.
* If we have continuous integration, it removes one of the biggest barriers 
    to **frequent deployment**.


**Roadmap to Continuous Integration**:

1. Get everything you need into **source control**.
2. One of the first steps is to get the **build automated**.
3. Introduce some **automated testing** into you build.
4. Try to **speed up** the commit build. 

If we are starting a new project, we **use Continuous Integration from 
the beginning**.

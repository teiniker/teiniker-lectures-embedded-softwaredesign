# Test Fixtures: SetUp and TearDown

If we find ourself writing two or more tests that operate on similar data, 
we can use a test fixture. This allows us to reuse the same configuration 
of objects for several different tests.

To create a fixture:

* Derive a class from `testing::Test`. Start its body with `protected:`, as 
    weâ€™ll want to access fixture members from sub-classes.

* Inside the class, we declare any objects we plan to use.

* If necessary, we write a **default constructor** or **SetUp()** function 
    to prepare the objects for each test. 

* If necessary, write a **destructor** or **TearDown()** function to release 
    any resources you allocated in `SetUp()`.

* If needed, we define **subroutines** for our tests to share.


_Example:_ Implementing a test fixture
```C++
class VectorTestFixture : public ::testing::Test 
{
protected:
    vector<int> numbers;

    void SetUp() override 
    {   
        // Initialize the vector before each test
        numbers = {7, 5, 16, 8}; 
    }

    void TearDown() override 
    {
        // Clean up after each test if necessary
    }
};
```

When using a fixture, we use **TEST_F()** instead of `TEST()` as it allows 
us to access objects and subroutines in the test fixture:
```C++
TEST_F(VectorTestFixture, Equals) 
{
    vector<int> expected = {7, 5, 16, 8};
    ASSERT_TRUE(expected == numbers);
}
```

Unlike `TEST()`, in `TEST_F()` the first argument must be the 
**name of the test fixture class** (`_F` stands for **Fixture**). 
No test suite name is specified for this macro.

We must first define a test fixture class before using it in a 
`TEST_F()`, or we will get the compiler error `virtual outside class declaration`.

For each test defined with `TEST_F()`, GoogleTest will create a 
**fresh test fixture** at runtime, immediately initialize it via `SetUp()`, 
run the test, clean up by calling `TearDown()`, and then delete the test 
fixture.

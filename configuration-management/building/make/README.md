# GNU Make

GNU **make** is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs 
and libraries from source code by reading files called **Makefiles**. 
Makefiles specify how to derive the target program from its dependencies. It is part 
of the GNU Project and is available on most Unix-like systems, including Linux 
and macOS. 

While primarily used for compiling C and C++ programs, `make` is versatile and can be 
used for various tasks like generating documentation, automating tests, and more.

Key features of make:
* **Dependency Tracking**: Automatically determines which parts of a program need 
recompilation based on file changes.
* **Automation** : Simplifies complex build processes with simple commands.
* **Portability**: Works across different Unix-like systems.
* **Flexibility**: Supports various programming languages and build processes.
* **Extensibility**: Allows custom rules and scripts.
* **Parallel Execution**: Can perform multiple jobs simultaneously, speeding up the build process.

# CMake 

CMake is an open-source, **cross-platform build system generator** that 
streamlines the process of compiling and managing software projects. 

By using simple configuration files called `CMakeLists.txt`, CMake 
automatically generates native build scripts (such as Makefiles or 
Visual Studio project files) tailored to the target platform and 
environment.

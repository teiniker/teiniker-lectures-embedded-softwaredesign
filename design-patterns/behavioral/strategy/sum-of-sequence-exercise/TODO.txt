Exercise: Strategy - Sum of Sequence
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a "SumOfSequence" interface, which declares an abstract method called 
"calculateSum(const int n)".

Implement two concrete implementations of that interface, using the following 
algorithms:
    - Loop strategy: Calculate the sum of the sequence using a loop.
    - Little Gauß strategy: Calculate the sum of the sequence using the 
      formula: n * (n + 1) / 2.

A) SumOfSequenceLoop (loop.h and loop.cpp)
    Implement the interface "SumOfSequence" in a sub-class named 
    "SumOfSequenceLoop" using the loop strategy

B) SumOfSequenceGauss (little_gauss.h and little_gauss.cpp)
    Implement the interface "SumOfSequence" in a sub-class named 
    "SumOfSequenceGauss" using the Little Gausß strategy.

Tip: Use the "test.cpp" file to test your implementations.

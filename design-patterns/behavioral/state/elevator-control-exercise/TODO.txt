Exercise: State - Elevator Control
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the State Machine and Class Diagram of an elevator control.

A) Controller (controller.cpp)
    Implement the declarations specified in the given "controller.h" file.
    This "Controller" class will be responsible for controlling the elevator
    by delegating the trigger events to the right state object.

B) StateBottom (state_bottom.cpp)
    Implement the "StateBottom" class as a concrete State.
    Make sure that the state transitions are implemented as shown in the State 
    Machine diagram.

C) StateUpward (state_upward.cpp)
    Implement the "StateUpward" class as a concrete State.
    Make sure that the state transitions are implemented as shown in the State 
    Machine diagram.

D) StateTop (state_top.cpp)
    Implement the "StateTop" class as a concrete State.
    Make sure that the state transitions are implemented as shown in the State 
    Machine diagram.

E) StateDownward (state_dowinward.cpp)
    Implement the "StateDownward" class as a concrete State.
    Make sure that the state transitions are implemented as shown in the State 
    Machine diagram.

Tip: Use the "test.cpp" file to test your implementations.

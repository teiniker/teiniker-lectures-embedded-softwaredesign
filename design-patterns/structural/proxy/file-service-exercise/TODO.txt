Exercise: Validation Proxy - FileService   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a "FileService" interface, and its implementation "FileServiceImpl".

Add a validation proxy to make sure that only "*.data" files are loaded. 

A) FileServiceProxy
Write a class called "FileServiceProxy" (file_service_proxy.h, file_service_proxy.cpp) 
that implements the "FileService" interface.
Via the constructor, it should take a pointer to the "FileService" object that 
it wraps.
It should also implement the "load" method, which should check if the 
file name ends with ".data". If it does not, it should throw an "invalid_argument" 
exception. 

Tip: Use the following helper method in FileServiceProxy:

bool FileServiceProxy::endsWith(const string& s, const string& suffix)
{
    return s.rfind(suffix) == (s.size()-suffix.size());
}

Tip: Use the "test.cpp" file to test your implementations.

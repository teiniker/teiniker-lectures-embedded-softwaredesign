Exercise: Composite - Packaging
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the "Node" class, implement the "Article" and "Box" classes which build 
the leaf and composite nodes of the tree structure.


A) Article (article.h and article.cpp)
	Write a constructor which initializes the name, weight and quantity of the
	article.
	Add the provate fields "std::string _name" and "int _quantity".
	Add a getter method for name. 
	Implement the "totalWeight()" method to calculate the total weight of the  
	article (weight * quantity).

B) Box (box.h and box.cpp)
	Write a constructor which initializes the weight of the box.
	Implement the "add()" method to add a new node to the box.
	Implement the "totalWeight()" method to calculate the total weight of the
	all children nodes of this box.

Tip: Use the "test.cpp" file to test your implementations.

Exercise: Filename Decorator - FileService   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a "FileService" interface, and its implementation "FileServiceImpl".

Add a decorator class (compine abstract and concrete Decorator in one class) 
to add "*.data" to the filename. 

A) FileServiceDecorator
Write a class called "FileServiceDecorator" (file_service_decorator.h, 
file_service_decorator.cpp) that implements the "FileService" interface.
Via the constructor, it should take a shared pointer to the "FileService" 
object that it wraps (constructor injection).

Implement the "load" method, which adds ".data" to the passed filename. 

Tip: Use the "test.cpp" file to test your implementations.

# Decorator 

> Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. 
> Decorators provide a **flexible alternative to subclassing** for 
> extending functionality.


## Applicability

* To add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and 
    transparently, without affecting other objects.

* For responsibilities that can be withdrawn.

* When extensions by subclassing is impractical.


## Structure

![Decorator Class Diagram](figures/decorator-classdiagram.jpg)

* `Component`: Defines the interface for objects that can have 
    responsibilities added to them dynamically.

* `ConcreteComponent`: Defines an object to which additional 
    responsibilities can be attached.

* `Decorator`: Maintains a reference to a Component object and defines 
    an interface that conforms to Component’s interface.

* `ConcreteDecorator`: Adds responsibilities to the component.


## Collaborations

A `Decorator` forwards requests to its `Component` object.

It may optionally perform additional operations before and after forwarding the request.


## Consequences

* **More flexibility than static inheritance**. With decorators, 
    responsibilities can be added and removed at runtime 
    simply by attaching and detaching them. 
    Decorators also make it easy to add a property twice.

* Decorator offers a **pay-as-you-go approach** to adding 
    responsibilities. We can define a simple class and add 
    functionality incrementally with `Decorator` objects. 
    As a result, an application needn’t pay for features it doesn’t 
    use.

* A **Decorated is not identical to the Component** itself. 
    Hence, we shouldn’t relay on object identity when we use decorators. 


## Implementation Issues

* **Interface conformance**: A `Decorator` object’s interface must conform 
    to the interface of the `Component` it decorates.

* **Omitting the Decorator class**: There’s no need to define a `Decorator`
    class when we only need to add one responsibility. In that case, we can 
    merge `Decorator`’s responsibility for forwarding requests to the 
    component into the `ConcreteDecorator`.


## Other Patterns 

### Decorator vs. Proxy

Decorator and Proxy **look very similar structurally**, but they 
**differ in intent**, behavioral guarantees, and how clients reason 
about them. 
The structure (same interface + wrapped object) is almost identical; 
the semantics are not.

> **Decorator adds responsibilities**, while **Proxy controls access** to an object.

Asqk this question: "If I remove this wrapper, does the program still behave the same?"
* **Yes**: It's a  Proxy
* **No**: It's a Decorator

Typical **Decorator use cases** are:
* Logging
* Metrics
* Authorization checks
* Retry logic
* Compression / encryption

Typical **Proxy use cases** are:

* Protection Proxy: Access control
* Virtual Proxy: Lazy initialization
* Remote Proxy: RPC / IPC
* Smart Proxy: Reference counting, copy-on-write

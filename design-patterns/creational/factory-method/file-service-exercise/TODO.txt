-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a "FileService" interface, and its implementation "FileServiceImpl".

Implement a Factory Method which creates an instance of "FileServiceImpl". 

A) FactoryImpl (factory_impl.h and factory_impl.cpp)
Implement a FactoryImpl class which implements the "Factoty" interface.
"createFileService()" returns an instance of "FileServiceImpl".
Use Smart Pointers to manage the memory.

Tip: Use the "test.cpp" file to test your implementations.

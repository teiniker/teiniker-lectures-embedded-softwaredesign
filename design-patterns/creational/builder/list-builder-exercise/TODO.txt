Exercise: Builder - ListBuilder
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a "ListBuilder" interface, which declares an "item()" method that can be
used to add items to a list.

Implement two concrete "ListBuilder" classes, one for JSON and one for XML 
representation of the list. 

A) ListBuilderJson (list-builder-json.h and list-builder-json.cpp files)
    Extend the "ListBuilder" interface and implement the "item()" method to
    add items to a list (a private std::vector instance).
    Implemnt a toJson() method that returns the JSON representation of the 
    list as a string.

B) ListBuilderXml (list-builder-xml.h and list-builder-xmlcpp files)
    Extend the "ListBuilder" interface and implement the "item()" method to
    add items to a list (a private std::vector instance).
    Implemnt a toXml() method that returns the XML representation of the 
    list as a string.

Tip: Use the "test.cpp" file to test your implementations.

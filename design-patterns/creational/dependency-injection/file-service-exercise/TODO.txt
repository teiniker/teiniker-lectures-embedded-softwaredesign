Exercise: Dependency Injection - File Service Proxy
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are given a validation proxy for a FileService.

The instantiation and destruction of the implementation class
are performed inside the proxy via its constructor and destructor.


A) Dependency Injection 
Refactor the "FileServiceProxy" class so the dependency on
"FileServiceImpl" is provided via constructor injection.
Use "shared_ptr<>" for your implementation.


B) Test Cases
Implement in the "test.cpp" file a function:

    shared_ptr<FileService> assemble_proxy(void)

that performs the instantiations and dependency injection.
Refactor the test cases so they use "assemble_proxy()" for setup.

# Layered Architectures


> **Layered Architecture** (N-Tier) structures a software application into multiple 
> layers (tiers), each serving a particular role within the system. 
> Typically, these layers are organized in a linear sequence, where **each 
> layer interacts only with the layer directly above or below it**. 

This hierarchical arrangement ensures a clear separation of concerns, 
making the system easier to manage and evolve.

N-Tier implies that the architecture can have any number of layers (tiers), 
but commonly, applications use a **three-tier** or four-tier setup.

## Benefits of Layered Architectures

* **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a distinct responsibility, 
    making the system easier to understand, develop, and maintain.

* **Modularity**: Layers can be developed, tested, and debugged independently, 
    facilitating parallel development and reducing complexity.

* **Ease of Testing**: Layers can be tested in isolation using unit tests, 
    integration tests, and other testing methodologies, ensuring higher quality 
    and reliability.

* **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer (e.g., switching the database 
    technology) have minimal impact on other layers, simplifying maintenance 
    and upgrades.

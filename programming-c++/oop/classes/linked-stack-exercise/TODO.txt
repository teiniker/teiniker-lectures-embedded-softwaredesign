Exercise: Stack based on a LinkedList
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a class "Stack" that stores a collection of "Node" objects in a 
LIFO(Last In First Out) way.
    
A) Implement "Stack" class:
    Given the "stack.h" file, implement the "Stack" class in a "stack.cpp" file.

B) UML Diagrams
    Draw a UML Classd Diagram for the "Stack" class (draw structures like  
    classes).
    Draw the UML Object Diagram after test setup.

Run the test cases implemented in "test.cpp" to verify your implementations.

Exercise: Bidirectional Association: User - Mail
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extend the classes "User" and "Mail" to add a bidirectional association. 

    User -[1]---[1]- Mail

A) User ---[1]-> Mail
    Add a forward declaration of the "Mail" class in the "User" class.
    Add a pointer to "Mail" in the "User" class.
    Extend the constructor of "User" to store the "Mail" pointer.
    Add accessor methods for the "Mail" pointer in the "User" class.

B) Mail ---[1]-> User
    Add a pointer to "User" in the "Mail" class.
    Extend the constructor of "Mail" to set the "User" pointer to NULL.
    Add accessor methods for the "User" pointer in the "Mail" class.

Run the test cases implemented in "test.cpp" to verify their implementations.

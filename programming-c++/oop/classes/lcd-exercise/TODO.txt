Exercise: Classes and Objects - LCD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement a class "LCD". Make sure you declare the class in "lcd.h" 
file and implement it in "lcd.cpp" file.

A) "LCD" should be implemented with the following attributes:
		size_t _cols;
		size_t _rows; 		
		size_t _index;
		char* _buffer;
    Note that _buffer is a pointer to a dynamically allocated array of chars 
    on the heap.

B) Also implement:
    - A constructor which takes "cols" and "rows" as arguments and initializes
        the "buffer" array on the heap.
    - A Destructor to free the memory allocated for "buffer".
    - A getter method for "buffer".

C) Implement the following methods to interact with the LCD:
    - void clear(): Clears the buffer and set the "index" to 0.
        
    - void print(char c): Copy the character "c" to the buffer starting from
        the current "index". Update the "index" to the next available position.

    - void print(const char* str): Copy the string "str" to the buffer starting
        from the current "index". Update the "index" to the next available position.
        
Run the test cases implemented in "test.cpp" to verify their implementations.

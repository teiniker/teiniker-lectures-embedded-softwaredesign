LabExam 2024-12-04: OOP - Electronic Parts Exercise (Simulation)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a base class "Part" which has the following attributes:
- id:int
- value:double
- unit:string
Part also declares a pure virtual function: std::string to_csv(void).

A) Resistor 
Implement a class "Resistor" (resistor.h, resistor.cpp) that inherits from 
"Part" and overrides the "to_csv()" function. 
Example: "Resistor,1,1.000E+03,Ohm"

B) Capacitor
Implement a class "Capacitor" (capacitor.h, capacitor.cpp) that inherits from 
"Part" and overrides the "to_csv()" function.
Example: "Capacitor,2,4.700E-06,Farad"

C) Refactoring 
Implement the common "to_csv()" functionality in the virual function of the
base class "Part" to reduce code redandancy.

Tip: Test your implementation using the "test.cpp" class.


General Rules
-------------
1. Project name: Rename the project (and the submitted ZIP file) so 
that instead of "MyName" your name is used. 
Please note that projects that do not comply with the naming 
convention will be deducted 50% of the points!

2. Manual review: A manual code review is performed for each solution 
when grading. 

3. Syntax errors: Implementation artifacts that contain syntax errors 
won't count.

4. Solutions that are obviously copied or copied will be assessed 
negatively (with 0 points).

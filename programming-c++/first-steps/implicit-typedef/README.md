# Implicit typedef of struct, union, and enum
C++ treats type tags as implicit typedef names. 

In C, when you want to use a struct, union, or enum, you have to assign a name to the 
type youâ€™ve created using the `typedef` keyword.

_Example:_ Define and use a structure type
```C++
struct Resistor 
{
    uint32_t value;
    uint8_t tolerance;
};

Resistor r;
r.value = 470;  
r.tolerance = 1;  
```

This is more convenient and saves some typing.

Note the naming convention, in C++ we **capitalize types**.

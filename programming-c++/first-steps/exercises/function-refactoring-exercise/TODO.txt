Exercise: Function Refactoring 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a C++ file called "i2c.cpp" that contains some operations and a "main()" 
function which checks the given implementations. 

You can compile and run this code using the play button or the following 
commands:
    $ c++ -g -Wall i2c.cpp -o i2c
    $ ./i2c

Now, you need to refactor this code towards more C++ style...

A) Separate header file and implementation
    Create a file called "i2c.h" which acts as the declaration file for 
    the functions in "i2c.cpp". 
    Don't forget to include the necessary header guards.

B) Adding a namespace   
    Add a namespace called "i2c" to the functions in "i2c.cpp" and "i2c.h".

C) Function overloading 
    Overload the "i2c_write()" function to accept different types of data. 

D) Default arguments
    Add default arguments to the "i2c_init()" function to make it more 
    flexible.    
    pin_scl is 1 by default, uint8_t pin_sda is 0 by default.

After removing the "main()" function from "i2c.cpp", we can use CMake to 
compile and run the code.

At the end, all the given test cases should pass.

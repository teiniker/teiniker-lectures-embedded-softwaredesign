# std::queue

The `std::queue` class is a container adaptor that gives the programmer 
the functionality of a queue - specifically, a **FIFO (first-in, first-out)** 
data structure.

The class template acts as a wrapper to the underlying container - only a specific 
set of functions is provided. The queue pushes the elements on the back of the 
underlying container and pops them from the front.

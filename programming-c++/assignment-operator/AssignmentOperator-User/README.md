# Assignment Operator

The assignment operator (operator=) is used to copy values from one object 
to another already existing object.

```C++
    ClassName& operator =(const lassName& orig);
```

The purpose of the copy constructor and the assignment operator are almost 
equivalent -- both copy one object to another. 

**The copy constructor initializes new objects, whereas the assignment operator 
replaces the contents of existing objects.**

The assignment operator must be overloaded as a member function.
	
The overloaded **operator=** returns ***this**, so that we can chain multiple 
assignments together.

# Software Design in C++

This project collects examples, exercises and model solutions needed to 
understand software design and architectures for embedded systems written in C++.

The following topics will be covered:

* Configuration Management
  * [Source Code Versioning](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-embeddedcomputing/tree/master/configuration-management/versioning)
  * [Build Automation](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-embeddedcomputing/tree/master/configuration-management/building)
  * [Test Automation](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-embeddedcomputing/tree/master/configuration-management/testing)
  
* Object-Oriented Design
  * [Classes and Objects](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-embeddedcomputing/tree/master/oo-design/README.md)
  * [C++ Language Features](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-embeddedcomputing/tree/master/c%2B%2Bfeatures)
  * [Design Patterns](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-embeddedcomputing/tree/master/design-patterns)
 
* Embedded Computing 
  
Note that this project is under construction and will grow over the next few weeks :-)

As a development environment, you can use a pre-configured Linux VM image:
